          Hello, my name is Harriet, and I'm a 22-year-old entrepreneur. In
          2019, I started learning to code because I was not rich. I
          reestablished contact with a friend who works in technology. He
          explained to me the advantages of working in the industry and how I
          could have a fulfilling life even if I worked from home. I got
          inspired at once. A solution to my main issue, which was money. Due
          to my involvement in school and an internship, I attempted to learn
          how to code twice before giving up. Because my supportive friends
          constantly encouraged me to pursue my interests, my desire remained
          intact. Being surrounded by people who were using technology in some
          way and having the desire still there.I chose front end development
          because of the beauty and simplicity I could provide with just a few
          lines of code. It seemed like I was practically working magic.
